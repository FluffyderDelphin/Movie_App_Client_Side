# Movie_App_Client_Side
This is my first App build with React. It allows the 'user' to register and login. After a Login the User get a Display of Movies. 
From there he can Click on the 'Moviecard' Buttons and display more Details, or he can view his own profile and update it. 
He can also search for a Movies with a Filter and make a list of Favorite Movies wich gets Displayed on his Profile.
